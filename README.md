# Emotion-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

This project detects emotions from facial expressions using deep learning. The model utilizes pre-trained architectures such as VGG16 and ResNet50V2 through transfer learning to improve accuracy. It includes data augmentation and class balancing for better performance.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Classifies emotions based on facial expressions.
- **Transfer Learning**: Uses VGG16 and ResNet50V2 pre-trained models for faster and more accurate results.
- **Data Augmentation**: Increases the training dataset through transformations like rotation and flipping.
- **Class Balancing**: Handles class imbalance to improve prediction fairness.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model performance with confusion matrices, classification reports, and AUC-ROC plots.
